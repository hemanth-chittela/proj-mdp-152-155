    var: kops_version_result.stdout_lines
In the above code, the variable "kops_version" is used to specify the version of Kops to be installed. The first task uses the "get_url" module to download the Kops binary from the specified URL, and saves it to the /usr/local/bin/kops directory. The second task makes the binary executable, and the third task verifies the installation by running the "kops version" command. Finally, the last task uses the "debug" module to display the version of Kops that was installed.

- name: Verify Kops installation
  command: kops version
  register: kops_version_result

- name: Display Kops version

In the above code, the first task uses the pip module to install Kops, and the state parameter is set to present to ensure that Kops is installed. The second task verifies the installation by running the kops version command, and the third task uses the debug module to display the version of Kops that was installed.

it is saying that pip not installed 
If the pip module is not installed, you can install it by using the apt or yum module, depending on the operating system you are using. Here's an example of how to install pip on Ubuntu using the apt module:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Install pip
  apt:
    name: python-pip
    state: present
And here's an example of how to install pip on CentOS using the yum module:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Install pip
  yum:
    name: python2-pip
    state: present


- name: Download Kops
  get_url:
    url: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/{{ kops_version }}/kops-linux-amd64
    dest: /usr/local/bin/kops
    mode: 0755

- name: Make Kops executable
  command: chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kops

- name: Verify Kops installation
  command: kops version
  register: kops_version_result

- name: Display Kops version
  debug:
    var: kops_version_result.stdout_lines
